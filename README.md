Personal Ansible Config
-----
Recently I have had to reinstall by OS 80 billion times. 
In doing so, I have been getting tired of manually keeping track of all the packages I like
installed, so I am starting to abstract this out to ansible. 

I am learning ansible at work in a larger envrionment, so this should be a nice
way to test out new things and play around, and hopefully get my homelab under tighter
control.
